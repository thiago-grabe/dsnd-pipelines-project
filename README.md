# StyleSense Product Recommendation Prediction

## Project Overview

This project develops a machine learning pipeline to predict whether customers would recommend women's clothing products based on their reviews. Built for StyleSense, a rapidly growing online women's clothing retailer, this automated system helps process the backlog of product reviews with missing recommendation data.

### Business Problem

StyleSense has experienced tremendous growth, leading to a backlog of product reviews where customers provided text feedback but didn't indicate whether they recommend the product. This project creates a predictive model to automatically determine recommendations based on:

- Review text content
- Product metadata (category, department, class)
- Customer demographics (age)
- Review characteristics (title, positive feedback count)

## Dataset

The dataset contains **8 features** for predicting customer recommendations:

### Features
- **Clothing ID**: Integer categorical variable for the specific product
- **Age**: Customer's age (positive integer)
- **Title**: Review title (text)
- **Review Text**: Review body content (text)
- **Positive Feedback Count**: Number of customers who found the review helpful
- **Division Name**: Product high-level division (categorical)
- **Department Name**: Product department (categorical)
- **Class Name**: Product class (categorical)

### Target Variable
- **Recommended IND**: Binary target (1 = recommended, 0 = not recommended)

## Technical Implementation

### ðŸ”§ Pipeline Architecture

The solution implements a comprehensive machine learning pipeline with the following components:

#### 1. **Data Preprocessing**
- **Numerical Features**: Standard scaling for age, feedback count, and clothing ID
- **Categorical Features**: One-hot encoding for division, department, and class names
- **Text Processing**: Advanced NLP preprocessing with lemmatization and stopword removal

#### 2. **Advanced NLP Techniques**
- Text cleaning and normalization
- Robust tokenization using simple split (multiprocessing-safe)
- Lemmatization using WordNet with fallback mechanisms
- Stopword removal with comprehensive fallback list
- TF-IDF vectorization with n-grams (1-2)
- Custom feature extraction (sentiment analysis, text statistics)

#### 3. **Feature Engineering**
- Text length features (character and word counts)
- Sentiment indicators (positive/negative word counts)
- Punctuation patterns (exclamations, questions)
- Readability measures (average word length)
- Capital letter ratio (emphasis detection)

#### 4. **Model Training & Evaluation**
- Multiple algorithms: Logistic Regression and Random Forest
- Cross-validation for robust performance estimation
- Comprehensive metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-Score
- Confusion matrices and classification reports
- Clean, warning-free execution with proper error handling

#### 5. **Hyperparameter Optimization**
- Grid search with cross-validation
- Parameter tuning for both preprocessing and model components
- F1-score optimization for balanced performance
- Single-threaded execution for stability with NLTK components
